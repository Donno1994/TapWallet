# TapWallet
A taproot dedicated wallet. It can spend via keypath and scriptpath.
This wallet is still under development and is risky to use.
Although mainnet is possible, I recommend using testnet only.
With this wallet you can create timelock scripts which I have not heavily tested.
There are still several bugs. 
If you want to help, you can test this wallet (on testnet) and tell me your experience.
